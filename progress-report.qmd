## Literature Review

OCR

- Choi et al., *“Finetuning Vision-Language Models as OCR Systems for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study of Manchu.”* (2025)


Machine Translation

- Seo et al., *“Mergen: The First Manchu-Korean Machine Translation Model Trained on Augmented Data.”* (2024)
- Pei et al., *“Understanding In-Context Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Manchu.”* (2025)


## Data and Methods

Parallel Corpora

*The Diary of a Manchu Soldier in Seventeenth-Century China* (Cosmo annotated, 2006)
   - size: 771 sentences
   - vocab siz: 961 words

*The Dream of the Red Chamber* (Cao, 1792)
  - source: Sibe translation (1993, Mu)
  - reference: English translation (1891, Joly)
  - size: 340 sentences, vocab size: 669 words

Models

- Baseline: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network (LSTM) and Attention
- Apply transfer learning with Pre-trained model
  - *Mergen*: Manchu-Korean NMT (Seo et al. 2024)
